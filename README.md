# data-441-applied-machine-learning


My name is Greatness Emmanuel-king. I'm a Data Science major in my final year (but not final semester) of college.

Last summer, I interned at Amazon as a Data engineer intern and worked on building a data pipeline for tracking the performance of Amazon ads on search engines like Google, Bing, etc.

This semester, I'm currently engaged in a research project with Prof Nwala, focused on toponym recognition and resolution in local news papers.
